I’m **Jaya Teja Reddy**, a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in Theoretical Machine Learning. I completed my B.Tech in CSE from [JNTUA College of Engineering](https://jntuacep.ac.in/), Pulivendula, and went on to pursue my M.Tech in CSE from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). My research during M.Tech centered on Fairness in Machine Learning models, where I focused on implementing **Fairness constraints in Maximum Margin Clustering**.

Beyond my thesis, I actively explore ML and DL research papers, keeping myself engaged with the latest advancements in the field. My core interests span Machine Learning & Deep Learning research, ML systems, Distributed Systems, and Backend Engineering.

Currently, I’m working as an Analyst at Axtria.
